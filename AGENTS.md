# Agent Instructions

## Post-Feature Testing

After completing any feature or fix, the agent MUST:

1. Run `pnpm test` to verify the complete unit-test suite passes
2. If any test fails, fix the issue immediately
3. Re-run `pnpm test` until all tests pass

This ensures the codebase remains in a working state at all times.

## Git Commits

When making a commit on behalf of the user, NEVER prefix your commit message with `fix:`, `feature:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, or any other prefix. 
Just write a descriptive sentence of what was changed.

## Release Process (MANDATORY)

When releasing a new version, follow this exact process:

1. **Version Check**: Check if version already exists with `git log --oneline | grep "^[a-f0-9]\+ [0-9]"`
2. **Version Bump**: Update version in `package.json`. If the releas only includes bug 
fixes, bump a patch version  (e.g., `0.1.16` → `0.1.17`). If it includes new features, bump a minor version  (e.g., `0.1.16` → `0.2.0`)
Do not bump the major version.
3. **Commit ALL Changed Files**: `git add . && git commit -m "Fixed issue with autostart"`
   - Always commit using a description of what was changed as the commit message. 
   - Include ALL modified files in the commit (bin/, lib/, test/, README.md, etc.)
4. **Push**: `git push origin master` — this repo's release branch is `master`, and GitHub Actions will auto-publish to npm
5. **Create GitHub Release**:
   ```bash
   gh release create VERSION --title "VERSION" --notes "Release notes"
   ```
   (e.g., `gh release create 1.5.0 --title "1.5.0" --notes "Fixed an issue with ABC"`)
   When writing the release notes, summarize the changes from all commits since the last release.
6. **Wait for npm Publish":
   ```bash
   for i in $(seq 1 30); do sleep 10; v=$(npm view modelrelay version 2>/dev/null); echo "Attempt $i: npm version = $v"; if [ "$v" = "0.1.17" ]; then echo "✅ published!"; break; fi; done
   ```
7. **Install and Verify**: `npm install -g modelrelay@0.1.17`
8. **Test Binary**: `modelrelay --help` (or any other command to verify it works)
9. **Only when the global npm-installed version works → the release is confirmed**

**Why:** A local `npm install -g .` can mask issues because it symlinks the repo. The real npm package is a tarball built from the `files` field — only a real npm install will catch missing files.

## Real-World npm Verification (MANDATORY for every fix/feature)

**Never trust local-only testing.** `pnpm start` runs from the repo and won't catch missing files in the published package. Always run the full npm verification:

1. Bump version in `package.json` (e.g. `0.1.14` → `0.1.15`)
2. Commit and push to `master` — this repo's release branch is `master`, and GitHub Actions auto-publishes to npm
3. Wait for the new version to appear on npm:
   ```bash
   # Poll until npm has the new version
   for i in $(seq 1 30); do sleep 10; v=$(npm view modelrelay version 2>/dev/null); echo "Attempt $i: npm version = $v"; if [ "$v" = "NEW_VERSION" ]; then echo "✅ published!"; break; fi; done
   ```
4. Install the published version globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g modelrelay@NEW_VERSION
   ```
5. Run the global binary and verify it works:
   ```bash
   modelrelay
   ```
6. Only if the global npm-installed version works → the fix is confirmed

**Why:** A local `npm install -g .` can mask issues because it symlinks the repo. The real npm package is a tarball built from the `files` field — if something is missing there, only a real npm install will catch it.

## Test Architecture

- Tests live in `test/test.js` using Node.js built-in `node:test` + `node:assert` (zero deps)
- Pure logic functions are in `lib/utils.js` (extracted from the main CLI for testability)
- The main CLI (`bin/modelrelay.js`) imports from `lib/utils.js`
- If you add new pure logic (calculations, parsing, filtering), add it to `lib/utils.js` and write tests
- If you modify existing logic in `lib/utils.js`, update the corresponding tests

### What's tested:
- **sources.js data integrity** — model structure, valid tiers, no duplicates, count consistency
- **Core logic** — getAvg, getVerdict, getUptime, sortResults, findBestModel
- **CLI arg parsing** — current router flags (`--port`, `--no-log`, `--ban`, `--onboard`)
- **Package sanity** — package.json fields, bin entry exists, shebang, ESM imports

## Model Quality Scores

Model quality is refreshed from OpenRouter's public Models API at runtime and cached for 24 hours. Use this source hierarchy, in order:

1. `benchmarks.artificial_analysis.coding_index / 100` (preferred)
2. Design Arena `models/codecategories` Elo converted to a 0–1 coding score by the regression trained from catalog models that have both values
3. The bounded metadata estimate in `lib/model-quality.js` (popularity, recency, coding capabilities, and context length)
4. `scores.js` as an offline fallback
5. `0.45` only when no catalog match or local fallback exists

Design Arena, metadata, local, and default scores MUST remain labeled as fallbacks. Never describe an estimated score as verified or silently substitute an invented benchmark.

### Audit Command

From the project checkout, always run the source version of the command—not a globally installed package:

```powershell
node .\bin\modelrelay.js refresh-scores
```

The command requires network access. It prints every configured or discovered model in descending score order, the source used, fallback markers, source counts, and provider-discovery warnings. A provider warning means the audit is incomplete; do not conclude that all models were checked.

When model aliases appear as separate rows, add canonical aliases in `sources.js` and a dated offline fallback in `scores.js`, then rerun the command. Keep score computation in `lib/model-quality.js` and add pure-logic tests in `test/test.js` whenever the hierarchy, matching, regression, or metadata formula changes.
