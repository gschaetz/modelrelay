### 🔥 100% Free • Auto-Routing • 80+ Models • 12+ Providers • OpenAI-Compatible

**modelrelay** is an OpenAI-compatible local router that benchmarks free coding models across top providers and automatically forwards your requests to the best available model. 

### ✨ Why use modelrelay?

- 💸 **Completely Free:** Stop paying for API usage. We seamlessly provide access to robust free models.
- 🧠 **State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Models:** Out-of-the-box availability for top-tier models including **Kimi K2.5, Minimax M2.5, GLM 5, Deepseek V3.2**, and more.
- 🏢 **Reliable Providers:** We route requests securely through trusted, high-performance platforms like **NVIDIA, Groq, OpenRouter, OpenCode Zen, Ollama, Kiro, and Google**.
- ⚡ **Lightning Fast:** The built-in benchmark continually evaluates metrics to pick the fastest and most capable LLM for your request.
- 🔄 **OpenAI-Compatible:** A perfect drop-in replacement that works seamlessly with your existing tools, scripts, and workflows.

## 🚀 Install via NPM

```bash
npm install -g @schaetzkc/modelrelay

# Start it
modelrelay
```

Once started, modelrelay is accessible at `http://localhost:7352/`.

Router endpoint:

- Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:7352/v1`
- API key: any string
- Model: `auto-fastest` (router picks actual backend)

## 🚀 Install via Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose (the `docker compose` command)


```bash
mkdir modelrelay

cd modelrelay

curl -fsSL -o Dockerfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gschaetz/modelrelay/master/Dockerfile
curl -fsSL -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gschaetz/modelrelay/master/docker-compose.yml

docker compose up -d --build
```

Once running, modelrelay is accessible at `http://localhost:7352/`.

## 🔌 Connect your tools

Run the guided setup to save provider keys and auto-configure OpenClaw or OpenCode:

```bash
modelrelay onboard
```

Prefer to configure by hand? See [Integrations](https://schaetzkc.com/modelrelay/integrations/) (OpenCode) and [OpenClaw](https://schaetzkc.com/modelrelay/openclaw/) for copy-paste configs.

## 🎯 Route by need, not by model name

Free models come and go, so instead of hard-coding one, ask the router for what you need as the request's `model`:

| Model | Routes to |
|---|---|
| `auto-fastest` | the best model overall |
| `tag:coding` | the best available model carrying that tag (`coding`, `reasoning`, `general`, `fast`, `agentic`, or your own) |
| `tag:coding+min_ctx:64k` | same, but only models with at least a 64k context window |
| `auto-fastest+exclude:groq/qwen/qwen3.8-27b` | the best model, never that one |

Details: [Routing](https://schaetzkc.com/modelrelay/routing/) and [Endpoints](https://schaetzkc.com/modelrelay/endpoints/).

## 📊 Reliability-aware

modelrelay tracks how each provider/model behaves on your real requests (successes, rate limits, server errors, dropped streams, latency) and demotes models that keep failing, even if their health pings look fine. Only counts and timings are stored, locally. See [Telemetry](https://schaetzkc.com/modelrelay/telemetry/).
