## 🔌 Installing Integrations

Use `modelrelay onboard` to save provider keys and auto-configure integrations for OpenClaw or OpenCode.

```bash
modelrelay onboard
```

If you prefer manual setup, use the examples below.

## OpenCode Integration

`modelrelay onboard` can auto-configure OpenCode.

If you want manual setup, put this in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "router": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "modelrelay",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:7352/v1",
        "apiKey": "dummy-key"
      },
      "models": {
        "auto-fastest": {
          "name": "Auto Fastest"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "model": "router/auto-fastest"
}
```

## OpenClaw Integration

`modelrelay onboard` can auto-configure OpenClaw.

If you want manual setup, merge this into `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "modelrelay": {
        "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:7352/v1",
        "api": "openai-completions",
        "apiKey": "no-key",
        "models": [
          { "id": "auto-fastest", "name": "Auto Fastest" }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": {
        "primary": "modelrelay/auto-fastest"
      },
      "models": {
        "modelrelay/auto-fastest": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## CLI

```bash
modelrelay [--port <number>] [--log] [--ban <model1,model2>]
modelrelay onboard [--port <number>]
modelrelay install --autostart
modelrelay start --autostart
modelrelay uninstall --autostart
modelrelay status --autostart
modelrelay update
modelrelay autoupdate [--enable|--disable|--status] [--interval <hours>]
modelrelay autostart [--install|--start|--uninstall|--status]
modelrelay config export
modelrelay config import <token>
```

Request terminal logging is disabled by default. Use `--log` to enable it.

`modelrelay install --autostart` also triggers an immediate start attempt so you do not need a separate command after install.

During `modelrelay onboard`, you will also be prompted to enable auto-start on login.

`modelrelay update` upgrades the global npm package and, when autostart is configured, stops the background service first and starts it again after the update.

Auto-update is enabled by default. While the router is running, modelrelay checks npm periodically (default: every 24 hours) and applies updates automatically.

Use `modelrelay autoupdate --status` to inspect state, `modelrelay autoupdate --disable` to turn it off, and `modelrelay autoupdate --enable --interval 12` to re-enable with a custom interval.

Use `modelrelay config export` to print a transferable config token (base64url-encoded JSON), and `modelrelay config import <token>` to load it on another machine.
You can also import by stdin:

```bash
modelrelay config export | modelrelay config import
```

## Endpoints

### `/v1/chat/completions`

`POST /v1/chat/completions` is an OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint.

- Use `model: "auto-fastest"` to route to the best model overall
- Use a grouped model ID such as `minimax-m2.5`, `kimi-k2.5`, or `glm4.7` to route within that model group
- For grouped IDs, modelrelay selects the provider with the best current QoS for that group
- Use `model: "tag:<name>"` (e.g. `tag:coding`) to route to the best currently available model carrying that tag — either a curated capability tag or a custom tag you've assigned in the Web UI (see [Model tags](#model-tags)). This is useful because the free models behind modelrelay come and go as availability changes — routing by tag survives a given model disappearing, where routing by a specific model/group ID does not.
- Append `+min_ctx:<size>` to `tag:<name>` or `auto-fastest` to additionally require a minimum context window, e.g. `tag:general+min_ctx:32000` or `auto-fastest+min_ctx:128k`. `<size>` accepts a raw token count or a `k`/`m` suffix. Models whose context window can't be determined, or is smaller than the requirement, are excluded. See [Model tags](#model-tags).
- In the Web UI, pinned models can now use either `Canonical Group` mode (default, pins the same model across providers) or `Exact Provider Row` mode from `Settings`
- Streaming and non-streaming requests are both supported

### `/v1/models`

`GET /v1/models` returns the models exposed by the router.

- Model IDs are grouped slugs such as `minimax-m2.5`, `kimi-k2.5`, and `glm4.7`
- Each grouped ID can represent the same model across multiple providers
- When you select one of these IDs in `/v1/chat/completions`, modelrelay routes the request to the provider with the best current QoS for that model group
- `auto-fastest` is also exposed and routes to the best model overall
- Each entry includes a `tags` array combining curated capability tags with any user-defined tags (see [Model tags](#model-tags))

Example:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    { "id": "auto-fastest", "object": "model", "owned_by": "router" },
    { "id": "minimax-m2.5", "object": "model", "owned_by": "relay", "tags": ["agentic", "general", "coding"] },
    { "id": "kimi-k2.5", "object": "model", "owned_by": "relay", "tags": ["agentic", "coding", "general"] },
    { "id": "glm4.7", "object": "model", "owned_by": "relay", "tags": ["agentic", "coding", "general"] }
  ]
}
```

### Model tags

Every model carries one or more capability tags, combined from two sources:

- **Curated tags** come from a fixed vocabulary — `coding`, `reasoning`, `general`, `fast`, `agentic` — maintained by project maintainers in `tags.js`.
- **Custom tags** are freeform labels you assign yourself. In the Web UI, open a model row and edit **Custom Routing Tags**. Assignments are keyed to the canonical model, shared across its providers, and stored in `~/.modelrelay.json`.

Use `model: "tag:<name>"` in `/v1/chat/completions` to route to the best currently available model carrying that tag — curated or custom — instead of naming a specific model. For example, assign `coding` to a few models in the UI, then request `model: "tag:coding"`; normal QoS ranking, availability filtering, and retry behavior choose the best currently eligible tagged model.

#### Minimum context window (`min_ctx`)

Tag membership alone doesn't guarantee a model can fit your prompt — a tag can span models with very different context windows. Append `+min_ctx:<size>` to filter those out before QoS ranking runs:

- `tag:general+min_ctx:32000` — best available `general`-tagged model with at least 32,000 tokens of context
- `tag:coding+min_ctx:128k` — same, for `coding`, using the `k` shorthand
- `auto-fastest+min_ctx:1m` — fastest model overall with at least 1,000,000 tokens of context, no tag restriction

`<size>` accepts a plain token count (`32000`) or a `k`/`m` suffix (`32k`, `1m`). Models with no known context window, or a smaller one than requested, are excluded from consideration. An unparseable or unrecognized modifier is ignored, falling back to the unmodified `tag:<name>` or `auto-fastest` behavior rather than erroring.

Modelrelay uses context data reported by the selected provider when it is available. Otherwise, it uses a provider-specific curated value from `sources.js`. It does not copy a context size between providers. It also keeps the context unknown when neither source has a value. For Ollama, the allocated or configured context is usable for this filter. The model maximum alone is not sufficient.

A provider's reported (or curated) context window is an upper bound, not a guarantee — some providers advertise a much larger window than a given account can actually push through in one request (seen live on newly-listed Groq models whose real per-minute token quota was a fraction of their reported context). When modelrelay has already observed a live rate-limit reading for a model (from that provider's response headers, captured on any prior request whether it succeeded or failed), `min_ctx` matching uses the smaller of the reported context and that observed quota. This is populated automatically as requests happen; there's nothing to configure, and it only ever makes filtering stricter, never looser.

#### Excluding specific models (`exclude`)

Append `+exclude:<id1|id2>` to `tag:<name>` or `auto-fastest` to steer a request away from one or more specific models, by bare model ID or provider-qualified `provider/modelId` key, separated by `|`:

- `tag:general+exclude:groq/qwen/qwen3.8-27b` — best `general`-tagged model, never that exact provider row
- `auto-fastest+exclude:qwen/qwen3.8-27b|qwen/qwen3.6-27b` — fastest model overall, excluding those two by bare ID across any provider

This composes with `min_ctx` in either order (e.g. `tag:general+min_ctx:32000+exclude:groq/qwen/qwen3.8-27b`), and follows the same matching and case-insensitivity rules as modelrelay's own internal per-request retry exclusion. Note: nothing in modelrelay's own proxy config today populates this dynamically on your behalf — it's a primitive for a caller that already knows a specific model ID it wants to avoid (for example, a retry layer that read the failed model out of a prior response), not something that reacts to failures automatically by itself. For automatic retry-with-a-different-model behavior on a single request, see how `auto-fastest`/`tag:<name>` already retry internally across candidates when a request fails.

### QoS: how speed and quality are weighed

`auto-fastest`, grouped-ID, and `tag:<name>` routing all rank eligible candidates by a QoS score that blends a model's quality (its `intell` percentile among all known models) with its recently observed average latency. Latency is scored continuously and never fully bottoms out at zero — a model averaging 1.1s and one averaging 4 minutes are not treated as equivalent just because both are technically "up" and returning HTTP 200. The latency discount is `target / (target + avg)`: an instant response scores 1.0, a model averaging exactly the configured target scores 0.5, and the score keeps decaying continuously past that — but it always remains a nonzero (last-resort) candidate rather than being excluded outright. Exclusion is still a separate, explicit action (ban a model, or set a minimum coding score / excluded providers list).

The target is `qosLatencyTargetMs`, configurable in the Web UI under **Settings → QoS Latency Target (ms)** (default: 3000ms). Lower it to weight speed more heavily against quality; raise it to let quality dominate over a wider range of observed latencies. It applies uniformly to `auto-fastest`, `tag:<name>`, grouped-ID, and pinned-model routing.

## Config

- Router config file: `~/.modelrelay.json`
- API key env overrides:
  - `NVIDIA_API_KEY`
  - `GROQ_API_KEY`
  - `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`
  - `SAMBANOVA_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `OPENCODE_API_KEY`
- `OLLAMA_API_KEY`
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`
- `OLLAMA_MODEL`
  - `CODESTRAL_API_KEY`
  - `HYPERBOLIC_API_KEY`
  - `SCALEWAY_API_KEY`
  - `KIRO_REFRESH_TOKEN`
  - `KIRO_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (optional, for AWS Builder/IDC refresh flow)
  - `KIRO_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional, for AWS Builder/IDC refresh flow)
  - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

Kiro OAuth notes:
- Base endpoint is preconfigured to `https://codewhisperer.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/generateAssistantResponse`
- Current Kiro model IDs include `claude-sonnet-4.5` and `claude-haiku-4.5`
- Authentication uses OAuth access tokens refreshed from:
  - `KIRO_REFRESH_TOKEN`, or
  - `~/.aws/sso/cache` (auto-detected refresh token), following OmniRoute’s approach.

For hosted Ollama, set `OLLAMA_API_KEY` and optionally override `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` / `OLLAMA_MODEL`.
If you leave the Ollama base URL blank in the UI, modelrelay defaults to `https://ollama.com/v1`.
With a valid Ollama API key, modelrelay will discover available Ollama models automatically.
If you point Ollama at a local host such as `http://127.0.0.1:11434`, modelrelay will also auto-discover models and does not require an API key.

### OpenAI-Compatible endpoints

modelrelay supports configuring multiple OpenAI-compatible upstream endpoints (vLLM, llama.cpp, custom relays, etc.). Each endpoint exposes a single model id and is routed independently.

- In the Web UI, click `+ Add Endpoint` under the **OpenAI-Compatible endpoints** group, supply a name, base URL, model id, and optional API key. Each endpoint then gets its own provider row with status, ping, and rate-limit information.
- modelrelay automatically probes `/v1/models` on each endpoint and exposes every returned model as a routable row. The manually configured model id (if any) is merged in as a fallback. Discovery is on by default and can be toggled per-endpoint with the **"Discover models from `/v1/models`"** checkbox.
- Endpoints are stored in `~/.modelrelay.json` under composite keys like `openai-compatible:my-vllm`:
  ```jsonc
  {
    "apiKeys": {
      "openai-compatible:my-vllm": "sk-…",
      "openai-compatible:groq-clone": "sk-…"
    },
    "providers": {
      "openai-compatible:my-vllm":    { "enabled": true, "name": "Local vLLM", "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "modelId": "qwen-coder" },
      "openai-compatible:groq-clone": { "enabled": true, "name": "Groq Clone", "baseUrl": "https://example/v1",        "modelId": "llama-3.3-70b" }
    }
  }
  ```
- Legacy single-endpoint configs (a bare `openai-compatible` entry without an instance suffix) are migrated automatically to `openai-compatible:default` on first run.
- The legacy env vars `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` continue to work and apply to the `:default` instance.
- Endpoints can also be managed via the API: `POST /api/openai-compatible/endpoints` (body: `{name, baseUrl, modelId, apiKey?}`) and `DELETE /api/openai-compatible/endpoints/<id>`.

### Config migration (CLI + Web UI)

- In the Web UI, open `Settings` -> `Configuration Transfer` to export/copy/import a token.
- The token includes your full config (including API keys, provider toggles, pinning mode, bans, filter rules, and auto-update settings).
- Treat tokens as secrets. Anyone with the token can import your keys/settings.
- Alternative: copy the config file directly from `~/.modelrelay.json` to the other machine at the same path (`~/.modelrelay.json`).

## Troubleshooting

### Clicking the update button or running `modelrelay` won't perform an update

To trigger a manual npm update and restart the service, run:

```bash
npm i -g @schaetzkc/modelrelay@latest
modelrelay autostart --start
```

### Testing updates locally without publishing to npm

You can point the updater at a local tarball instead of the npm registry:

```bash
npm pack
MODELRELAY_UPDATE_TARBALL=./modelrelay-1.8.3.tgz pnpm start
```

If you want the Web UI to always show an update while testing, set a higher forced version:

```bash
MODELRELAY_FORCE_UPDATE_VERSION=9.9.9
```

If the tarball filename does not contain a semantic version, also set:

```bash
MODELRELAY_UPDATE_VERSION=1.8.3
```

When `MODELRELAY_UPDATE_TARBALL` is set, the Web UI update flow and `modelrelay update`
install from that tarball and bypass the normal Git checkout update block. This is for
local testing only. `MODELRELAY_FORCE_UPDATE_VERSION` only affects version detection; the
actual install still comes from the tarball path.
